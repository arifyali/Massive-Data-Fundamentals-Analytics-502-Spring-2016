PS02 Answers:

1a. If your cluster has 1 node, how many wall clock seconds and how
    many clock seconds (total, across all nodes) will be spent in the map
    phase:

1a.A: 10*31 clock seconds and the same amount of wall clock time since there is only one node

1b. How much time will be spent in the reduce phase:

1b.A: 100 clock seconds total and the same amount of wall clock time since there is only one node

1c. How much time will be spent from the beginning of the job to the end:

1c.A: 10*31+100 clock seconds/wall clock seconds 

1d. Explain your answer:

1d.A: There are 31 mapper jobs and one reducer job. Since we are running on only one node, we just 
have to sum the clock seconds. Since there is only one node, there is no difference between wall clock
seconds and clock seconds  


2: If your cluster has 10 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

2.A: Wall Clock seconds would be round(31/10)*10+10+100=140 Seconds. Clock Seconds would be 10*31+100.

3: If your cluster has 100 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

3.A: Wall Clock seconds would be ceiling(31/100)*10+100 Seconds = 110 Seconds. Clock Seconds would be 10*31+100.

4: If your cluster has 1000 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

4.A: Wall Clock seconds would be ceiling(31/1000)*10+100 Seconds = 110 Seconds. Clock Seconds would be 10*31+100. As in case 3, the number of nodes is more than the number of mapper jobs

EC1: For 02/01/13, the logs only count the first 24 minutes for that day.
